# Scope

This group is focused on defining and explaining and idea called the
"Diagnostics Plane".

Roughly, the diagnostics plane is the idea that systems should expose specific
kinds of data that is useful for problem diagnosis (primarily) in a prescribed
way.  Doing so enables a variety of useful activities to take place.

## In Scope

* define the types of information that should be exposed from components and systems
* defines the useful structure for the information
* provides guidance on how to best solve common issues
* provide reference implementations illustrating how to implement a diagnostic
  interface for components

## Out of Scope

* data processing systems
* logging systems or aggregation systems
* statistic collection systems
